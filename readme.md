# Advent Of Code 2023 <img title="" src="./assets/icon.svg" align="left" width="90" style="padding-right: 0.5ch">
### A compilation of 2023 advent of code solutions written in Go

## How to use
Create an `inputs` folder in `assets` and populate it with the files corresponding to each day of advent of code. Or copy `examples` folder and rename it to `inputs`.
Next, paste your advent of code data into the appropriate files in the newly created folder and you're done.

To test the solutions on sample data, go to the `tests` directory and run `go test . -v`.
To run the program with the input data, go to the `cmd/aoc23` directory and run `go run . --day [DAY_NUMBER]`.

## Disclaimer
The solutions presented in this repository may differ from the optimal ones due to lack of experience in writing in Go. The main aim of the project is to become familiar with a new programming language so proceed at your own risk :)
